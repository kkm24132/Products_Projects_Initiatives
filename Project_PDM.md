I am involved in all stages of CRISP-DM phases and it is iterative and ongoing for multiple experiments / improvements and enhancements.

## Business Environment

The client is the largest banking organization in the world in terms of market capitalization, total assets, deposits, loans, number of customers and number of employees. This project was intended for one of their division in Latin America in Argentina.  ATM and branch operations has been a key area of focus for the bank and they wanted to embark on a transformational journey to leverage Data Science and Analytics for better return on investment, optimize their costs, improve customer satisfaction by ensuring increase in availability of install bases.

Client wanted to implement Predictive Maintenance solution to identify upcoming hardware failures before they arise and prevent them.

Some of the key benefits expected are as follows:
•	Reduce service related downtime and increase install base availability
•	Reduce service cost through logistics optimization and reduction of reactive tickets
•	Increase lifetime of assets, their components for better end-customer satisfaction
•	Improve management of failure risk exposure
 
There was no method or system available to optimally predict failure of ATM devices and its components using machine learning by considering multiple algorithm approaches and providing the most effective approach to address the problem. Secondly, manual prediction based on historical data or trend only, leads to inaccurate result, incorrect decisions, thus impacting availability issues of a device and huge loss to firms that impacts “availability of business” and leading to customer dissatisfaction. Thirdly, IT support taskforce of any firm will have multiple levels of support and there is a tremendous need to determine optimal deployment of field engineers to tackle problems related to devices that are installed across various geographies based on effective prediction.

I have been involved as a Senior Data Scientist for more than a year now in this offering / program, responsible for delivering solution / predictions in production on a monthly basis for the client. This solution has been in production for 6+ months now. This has been an ongoing journey for IBM where we have multiple teams located across various geographies. My collaboration with data analysts, program managers and all stakeholders have been fundamental throughout the entire life cycle of the program. I have worked closely with team in Europe geography and we as a team have provided solutions which has impacted significant client value. We used to provide our inputs and solution to local teams based out of Argentina from IBM and they used to interact with clients to deliver the solution to them.
