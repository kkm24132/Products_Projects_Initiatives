# Major Project Details of KAMALA KANTA MISHRA

This repository contains major projects, solutions, products, initiatives worked by me during my professional career. This is non-exhaustive and I have attempted to provide a very high level summary of major work performed in last few years, leveraging Data Science. Not all projects are captured here. Only significant Data Science focused projects are captured to provide a reflection of my deep expertise in the sector and significant global outcomes accomplished as part of these initiatives.

**Key dimensions:**
- Confidence shown to Clients, Stakeholders by demonstrating end-to-end CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework
- Outcomes, Value and Impact demonstrated to Clients, Stakeholders with tangible aspects such as - Public Client Reference of the work, A% cost savings, B% Availability improvement, C% prediction accuracy etc.
- Recommendations as a partner in the areas of MLOps, ML Explainability, Data drift, Model drift, Responsible AI/ML, Ethical AI/ML etc.
- Multiple breadth of Data Science problems solved such as Classification, Clustering, Neural Networks, Forecasting, Survival Analytics, Deep Learning etc.
- Use cases solved for multiple domains such as Banking and Financial Services, Insurance, Retail and CPG, Healthcare, Manufacturing etc.
- Use cases solved across functions within X Analytics for Data Science such as - Customer Analytics, Risk Analytics, Marketing Analytics, Predictive Analytics, Healthcare Analytics etc.
- Innovation and Thought Leadership dimension linked to Data Science work (in terms of filing patents, presenting papers in conferences, blogging, mentoring etc.)

## Major Projects / Products / Initiatives 

Project/Product/Initiative Name | Description  | Data Science Techniques Used | Business Outcomes, Impact and Value
--------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------
Failure prediction model for Predictive Maintenance - [Click Here for Details](/Project_PDM.md)  (Customers: World's largest Bank by Assets, Leading Banks from Europe) | End to end ensemble based advanced machine learning solution to identify upcoming failure predictions for devices and components. The Data Science solution involved Microservices based cloud native solution using MLOps; GitHub pipeline for maintainability, scalability and flexibility; code development using Python, R, IBM Watson suite of products; Algorithms used – Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM as part of experimentation and model solutioning. | End to End Data Science CRISP-DM Framework, Classification, Microservices based architecture, Precision/Recall/F1score for Model evaluation metric, MLOps framework (Model serving, Model monitoring and Model management) | Public Client Reference, Availability up by upto 2-3 percentage points, Prediction of failures up to 50% for future period, Predictions at device and component level
Forecasting equipment sales - [Click Here for Details](/Project_FES.md) | The objective was to develop an approach to forecast sales for customer’s machinery equipment for next 3 years and customer wanted us to be able to provide them clarity with exploratory data analysis so that they have “end to end visibility” of what is happening. I have used machine learning models using ARIMA, Holt winters, LSTM to provide forecasting solutions | Forecasting, ARIMA, Holt Winters, LSTM | Machine Learning solution provides ability to forecast for next few months for Customer and drive their business effectively
Customer analytics solution - [Click Here for Details](/Project_CA.md) | The customer which is a global financial services major was facing challenges profiling their customers / end users that are vulnerable to churn and wanted us to help them in devising retention strategies for retention of their end customers. We have used Machine Learning solution to classify customers in different buckets and help in decision making and insights. | Classification, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees | Ability to provide Next Best Offers to Customers and Increase up to 8%-10% of their revenue
Clustering patients for specialty pharmacy - [Click Here for Details](/Project_CPSP.md) <br> (World's leading Biotech firm) | Clustering of patients for Specialty pharmacy for one of the largest biotech major to provide an ability to view patient services metrics, view weekly patient update based on specific product, to understand prescriber uptake and to cluster group of patients with similar characteristics to be able to offer specific product and services to those set of patients | PCA for dimenstionality reduction, selected specific features for consideration, KMeans, Euclidean distance, Jacquard's distance, Gower's dissimilarity coefficient, Elbow criteria | Customer / Patient satisfaction increase up to 10 percent points, Customer visit cost to hospitals reduced by up to 40 percent points, Alignment of drugs/products efficient due to better inventory of those products
