# Introduction
This repository contains major projects, solutions, products, initiatives worked by me during my professional career. This is non-exhaustive and I have attempted to provide a very high level summary of major work in last few years.

## Major Projects / Products / Initiatives 

Project/Product/Initiative Name | Description  | Data Science Techniques Used | Business Outcomes, Impact and Value
--------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------
Failure prediction model for Predictive Maintenance <br> (World's largest Bank by Assets, Largest bank from Europe) | End to end ensemble based advanced machine learning solution to identify upcoming failure predictions for devices and components. The Data Science solution involved Microservices based cloud native solution using MLOps; GitHub pipeline for maintainability, scalability and flexibility; code development using Python, R, IBM Watson suite of products; Algorithms used â€“ Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM as part of experimentation and model solutioning. | <ul> <li> End to End Data Science CRISP-DM Framework <li> Classification method using Ensemble based models (Random Forest, extreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression) <li> DevOps / Microservices based architecture <li> Accuracy (Prec/Rec) improved upto 15-20 percent points <li> MLOps framework (Model serving, Model monitoring and Model management) </ul> | <ul> <li> Public Client Reference <li> Availability up by upto 2-3 p.p <li> Prediction of failures up to 50% for future period <li> Predictions at device and component level </ul>
Clustering Patients for Specialty Pharamcy <br> (World's leading biotech firm) | <ul> <li> Ability to provide Patient Insights (Patient services metrics and Weekly Patients view by KPIs) <li> PCA for dimenstionality reduction, selected specific features for consideration <li> ML - KMeans, Euclidean distance, Jacquard's distance, Gower's dissimilarity coefficient, Elbow criteria <li> Understanding on prescriber uptake <li> Cluster group of patients for better NBA on product recommendations </ul> | <ul> <li> Customer / Patient satisfaction increase up to 10 p.p. <li> Customer visit cost to hospitals reduced by up to 40 p.p. <li> Alignment of drugs/products efficient due to better inventory of those products </ul>
