## 1) Business Environment

The client is one of the largest insurance service providers in the world. As part of their transformation strategy, they wanted to deal with drivers pertaining to key business areas evolving around customer loyalty, attaining single view of customer, handle regulatory and compliance effectively, manage falling interest rates, tackle with commoditized products, improvise on agent productivity and so on.  They wanted to prioritize on some key initiatives revolving around their customers / end users and hence have partnered with our team to embark on an ambitious journey. They wanted to build a solution which will have the ability to predict the propensity to pay renewal premium and build an incentive plan for its agents. This will maximize the net revenue (i.e. renewals â€“ incentives given to collect renewals) collected from the policies post their issuance.

There was information available about past transactions from the policy holders along with their demographics. The client had provided aggregated historical transactional data like number of premiums delayed by 3/ 6/ 12 months across all the products, number of premiums paid, customer sourcing channel and customer demographics like age, monthly income and area type.
