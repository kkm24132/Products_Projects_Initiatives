I am involved in all stages of CRISP-DM phases and it is iterative and ongoing for multiple experiments / improvements and enhancements.

## 1)Business Environment

This program was to implement customer analytics solution for one of leading global financial services firm in the world. Consumer Banking, which is one of the largest divisions in the firm, provides financial services to consumers and small businesses including, banking, investments and lending products including business loans, mortgages, and credit cards. The financial major was facing challenges profiling their customers that are vulnerable to churn and devising retention strategy to those customers for retention. i.e.
- Ability to offer personalized product and services to customers to improve customer satisfaction and brand value
- Identify loyal customers and target specific promotions to retain them
- Reduce customer churn and thus manage risk

I have been involved as an analytics track lead for entire duration of the program. This was part of a solution that was built on top of the universal banking solution of the firm that was already implemented at customer environment and focus was to develop analytics layer from customer analytics perspective. I had to collaborate across multiple teams located across various geographies. My collaboration with programmer analysts, business analysts and all stakeholders have been fundamental throughout the entire life cycle of the program. I have worked closely with the global team and we as a team have provided solutions which has impacted significant client value and benefits. We did multiple workshops with customer subject matter experts, stakeholders to agree on specific scope from the broad roadmap they had as part of their larger strategy and mission.

The roadmap as part of broader engagement was defined to move from a customer acquisition scenario to customer development and then to customer retention phase. An illustrative snapshot of this is shown in the figure below.

Input data sources were – Core banking system, CRM system, e-Banking system.

Some of the key KPI themes that were defined are as follows (as part of broader roadmap):
- Campaign Performance – To analyze campaign activities based on the customers/opportunities created and converted, responses received etc.
- Customer Life Time Value and profitability – Identify customers and products that bring more revenue to the firm. Also to analyze how long customers are with the bank.
- Attrition and Loyalty – To identify customer level attrition. This will help in analysing attrition trends and risks with attrition.
- Cross-sell and product holding - To analyse and identify the product holding status of the customer, predict next best product that suits the customer and sell new products to them. 
- Transaction behaviour analysis - To generate and analyse recency, frequency and monetary value of the customer transaction and also analyse transaction behaviour.
- Service request analysis - To identify customers and products with high volume of complaints. To analyze service competency of the bank in terms of SLA and TAT management. 

Scope – There was complexity involved here since we have to look at larger roadmap, align to vision and then discuss with customer to agree to specific scope. The agreed scope and focus were to segment customers, look at their retention rate, perform life time value analysis and primarily predict if they are going to churn or not. Based on the information, the firm will take plan of action to tackle their customers who are at a high profitable band and would like to move out, formulate retain strategies for key customers and to propose personalized offers for them. There has been challenge in terms of complexity and various industry parameters with considerations from core banking, CRM and e-banking systems. We defined approach to drive the entire transformation in a step wise manner by looking into the scope, sub-setting into smaller tasks, templates for data attributes that are needed for analysis to solve the primary goal.
